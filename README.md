# Credit Card Default Prediction
## Overview
This project is aimed at predicting the case of customers default payments in Taiwan.
From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive accuracy of the
estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of
classification - credible or not credible clients. The main objective is to build a
predictive model, which could help them in predicting the customers who might
default in upcoming months.
Credit card default happens when you have become severely delinquent on your
credit card payments. Missing credit card payments once or twice does not count as
a default. A payment default occurs when you fail to pay the Minimum Amount Due
on the credit card for a few consecutive months.
The dataset contains 30000 rows and 25 columns. This project employed a binary
variable, default payment (Yes = 1, No = 0), as the response variable. After reviewing
the literature and the 23 variables are taken as explanatory variables.
